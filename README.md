# image-feature-learning-pytorch
A Pytorch implementation of Center Loss & Contrastive-Center Loss.

(Thanks: https://github.com/jxgu1016/MNIST_center_loss_pytorch)

* A Discriminative Feature Learning Approach for Deep Face Recognition: https://ydwen.github.io/papers/WenECCV16.pdf 

* Contrastive-center loss for deep neural networks: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07391


Modification/Addition:
* Implement Contrastive-Center Loss in addition to original one.
* Refactor and fix discrepancies between the paper and the implementation.
* Make calculation of center loss faster.
